## Prompt

```text
<inputs>
Ask me for: my product, the exact request a user types into it, 6 to 8 photos for the result cards, a royalty-free song around 130 BPM with a clear drop (Mixkit, free for commercial use), and my brand mark for the end card. If I skip anything, use the defaults: the food-ordering story below, food photos from Pexels (fire noodles, birria tacos, hot chicken, buffalo wings, smash burger, spicy ramen), and Mixkit "Cat Walk".
</inputs>

<direction>
A 15-second product launch film, 1920x1080 at 60fps. 2D only, one continuous take. No fades, blurs or cuts: each scene grows from the last. Text rises from a mask line, buttons expand into pages, and color floods from one object before shrinking into another. Give the camera one eased move per scene, and never zoom in and out consecutively.

Look: warm white canvas (#f5f5f2), black UI (#0e0e10), lime accent (#cdf24f), orange (#ff6a2a), and a blue send button (#2f6bff). Add an Apple Intelligence-style iridescent glow around the input: a blurred conic gradient rotating through pink, orange, lime, cyan and violet. Use real food photography on dark cards, Geist for UI and a serif for the product name on the end card.

Banned: crossfades, blur-ins, 3D, particles, camera moves that reverse direction, holds longer than 1s, anything that feels like a template.

<structure>
130 BPM, 32 beats (14.8s). Start the song 12 beats before its drop.

Beats 0-6, ask: push slowly into the glowing composer, about 3x zoom. Type the request over three fixed lines with a natural keystroke rhythm:
"I'm really hungry, I don't know
what I want but something
spicy, crispy and filling"

Beat 6, send: press the send button. A lime ripple spreads from it and transforms the message into a chat bubble. Pull back once to reveal the phone around it (428x900 screen, 11px black bezel, 9:41 status bar).

Beats 6-12, think: the send button grows into an orange wok, a half-disc with a thin handle. It tosses 6 colorful ingredients on beats 8, 9, 10 and 11 beneath the shimmering text "Finding something for you…".

Beat 12, the drop: a lime circle expands from the wok to fill the frame in about 0.35s. Dark food cards (330x440, radius 28, photo on top, name, one-line description, price and rating) burst in from the center. Slide the strip across three cards and land on "Fire Noodles", which lifts with a "Best match" pill.

Beats 16-21, chat: the lime contracts back into the user's bubble, carrying its words as the chosen card flies into its slot. "Found it. Fire Noodles from Wok & Fire, smoky, spicy and seriously filling." rises in, followed by "Want me to order it for you?" Then show two pills: "Order now" in black and "More options" outlined. The cursor clicks Order now → spinner → "✓ Ordered".

Beats 21-32, outro: the black button expands into the page, staying pill-shaped as it reaches the edges while the camera pushes into it. Its label grows to headline size, then slides away. Bring in "You were craving noodles." and "Now it's on the way." word by word (92px, white on black). A courier dot follows a route to a pin. The pin becomes the brand mark, and the wordmark wipes out from behind it, with "made with" above and the product name below.

<build>
1. One HTML file, 1920x1080. Compute every style from time inside seek(t): no CSS transitions, timers or state carried between frames.
2. Use one camera transform on a container, keyed by [time, zoom, x, y] with eased segments and zoom interpolated in log space.
3. Use closed-form step-response springs for every pop and settle.
4. Make every handoff a shared element: the lime flood carries a copy of the bubble's words, and the button carries its label into the page.
5. Sound: use a downloaded Mixkit SFX for each event - typing, send pop, each toss, drop impact, card swoosh, click, success tone, page-fill whoosh and mark sparkle. Place each by its measured peak and loudnorm to -14 LUFS.
6. Render with Playwright at 60fps using 8 subframes per frame, blended with ffmpeg tmix. Review every fast moment frame by frame and scan the full video frame by frame.
